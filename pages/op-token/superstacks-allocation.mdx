# SuperStacks Allocation

SuperStacks was a pilot program designed to show how the Superchain can create a more connected onchain experience. 
This was Optimism’s first GTM campaign in Superchain-wide incentives, a live test of how to reward the adoption of interoperable assets across chains focusing on usage, liquidity, and long-term contribution.

EOA addresses that provided liquidity in DEX pools, supplied liquidity on lending markets, or deposited into vaults between **April 16, 2025 16:00 UTC** and **June 30, 2025 23:59 UTC** were considered for the final OP delivery on OP Mainnet. SuperStacks allocated **2,500,000 OP** to **6,387** unique addresses based on activity on **Base, Unichain, Ink, World, Soneium**, and **OP Mainnet**.

<Callout type="info">
SuperStacks rewards need to be claimed. Go to [app.optimism.io/superstacks](https://app.optimism.io/superstacks) to claim.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Users that deposited into the WETH vault on Morpho through the Morpho mini app on World will claim their rewards in a SuperStacks mini app that goes live on World on **July 22, 2025**.
</Callout>

## XP Calculation

Addresses earned **10 XP per \$1 in liquidity** for every 24 hours, starting after the first full 24-hour period. XP was calculated separately for each qualifying pool or vault. Temporary XP multipliers increased the accrual rate above baseline.

> **Total XP Earned:** 208,530,214,850 XP

*   Only direct liquidity provision was included. 
Automated liquidity managers (ALMs) were excluded, except **Mellow**, which was directly integrated into the Velodrome frontend.

## OP Conversion

The XP earned was converted to OP tokens using:

```
(User XP / Total XP) × Total OP Allocated
```

Addresses with final rewards below **20 OP** are not eligible to claim. These tokens will be reallocated proportionally to eligible addresses. 
Allocation was strictly linear with no caps.

### OP-to-XP Conversion Rate

| XP   | OP                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| 1 OP | 70,094.8 – 86,988.3 XP         |
| 1 XP | 0.0000114958 – 0.0000142664 OP |

<Callout type="info">
The rewards conversion rate was calculated with support from Open Block Labs
