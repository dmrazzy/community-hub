# govNERDs Contribution Path

## What are govNERDs?

govNERDs are professional governance operators who execute infrastructure functions for the Optimism Collective. Selected through an attestation-based process, govNERDs ensure high-quality governance operations while reducing Foundation administrative burden.

## govNERD Positions

The govNERDs program operates with a streamlined structure of 4 specialized positions:

- **govNERDs Lead (1 position):** Coordinates the program, liaises with the Foundation, and develops Season 10+ attestation framework
- **Core govNERDs (3 positions):** Execute governance operations, support Grants Council, and serve as multisig signers

## Responsibilities of govNERDs

govNERDs are responsible for:

**Operational Support**

- Execute 100% of multisig transactions within 72 hours
- Support Grants Council with >7/10 satisfaction score
- Make voting announcements requiring minimal Foundation edits
- Attend internal Grants Council meetings
- Manage voting cycle announcements for Token and Citizens Houses

**Security and Multisig Operations**

- Serve as signers on community-owned multisigs for budget distribution
- Verify and sign transactions prepared by respective leads
- Maintain the Community Budget Tracker for financial transparency

**Community Engagement**

- Support projects and teams with governance participation

**Documentation & Education**

- Create and maintain governance resources
- Develop educational materials for governance participants
- Improve process documentation

**Time Commitment:** 8-10 hours per week per govNERD

## Selection Requirements

govNERDs are selected through an objective, attestation-based process that eliminates subjective evaluation:

**Required Attestations:**
- **Governance Contributor attestation** (indicating previous governance roles), OR
- **govNERD attestation** (proving prior program experience)

**Selection Process:**
1. Foundation generates list of qualified addresses
2. Candidates ranked by attestation count
3. Top 4 who complete opt-in form are invited
4. Ties broken through transparent random sampling

This is not an open contribution path. There are no applications, no subjective evaluations, and no political selection processes.

## How to Qualify

To become eligible for future govNERD selection:

**Obtain Required Attestations:**
- Contribute to Optimism governance to earn a Governance Contributor attestation
- Previous govNERDs automatically have govNERD attestations

**Monitor Selection Announcements:**
- Selection occurs at the beginning of each two-season term
- Qualified addresses will be published transparently

**Complete Opt-in Form:**
- If you're in the top-ranked candidates, complete the opt-in form when invited
- Confirm your two-season commitment

**Future Attestation Expansion:** The Foundation plans to expand qualifying attestations to include:
- Experience with grants programs
- Proven multisig operations expertise
- Additional technical competencies

## Performance & Accountability

govNERDs operate with transparent performance metrics:

- Public task completion tracking
- 360-degree reviews at season end
- Grant Council satisfaction scores (target >7/10)
- Specific KPIs for proposal quality and delegate engagement
- Community Budget Tracker for fund distribution transparency

## Tools & Coordination

govNERDs utilize:
- **Telegram** for real-time coordination
- **GitHub** for documentation and charter maintenance
- **Notion** for task management (internal use)
- **Forum** (gov.optimism.io) for formal governance processes
- **Multisig wallets** for budget operations

Regular meetings include:
- Bi-weekly Grants Council coordination
- As needed OP Fdn Syncs
- As needed govNERDs Team Syncs

## Program Evolution

The govNERDs program has evolved from an open volunteer contribution path to a professional governance infrastructure with:

- Guaranteed compensation for all positions
- Objective selection through attestations
- Two-season commitments for stability
- Clear performance metrics, including public task tracking and 360-degree reviews

The Season 8/9 Lead is establishing infrastructure for Season 10 algorithmic selection criteria, continuing the program's evolution toward fully automated governance operations.

govNERDs are not employees of the Collective, the Foundation, or any affiliates. They are independent contractors selected through transparent, objective criteria to execute critical governance operations.
