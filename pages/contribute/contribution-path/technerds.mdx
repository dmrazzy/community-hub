# TechNERDs

The TechNERDs program is designed to improve the technical support available to developers in the Optimism Ecosystem. Our core activities are carried out across three key platforms: the [Superchain Devs Discord](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1080862392281481246) for real-time collaboration, [Developer Support on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions) for technical discussions and issue tracking, and the [Optimism Docs](https://docs.optimism.io/) as the central knowledge base.


This program went through governance for funding. You can see more about the program in   
[TechNERDs S6](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/232),  
[TechNERDs S7](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/268),  
and [TechNERDs S8 (currently in progress)](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/283).

To participate, please review the [TechNERDs S8 Application Instructions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/283).  You can also join [Superchain Devs Discord](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1080862392281481246) to learn more and connect with the community.

## Knowledge Guide for TechNERDs

This knowledge guide outlines the core concepts, tools, and skills that every TechNERD should be familiar with. It is designed to help you build a strong technical foundation so you can better support developers across the community.

All topics below can be found in detail in the [Optimism Developer Docs](https://docs.optimism.io/):
